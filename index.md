### When/what/how to cache

*When?* Read a lot, but no/min updates.

*What?* Images, API call results, computational results (e.g., row heights).

*How?* Use NSCache, networking frameworks that supports caching, set cache policy (e.g., `NSURLRequest.CachePolicy.returnCacheDataElseLoad`).

### Swift Singleton

[Nice article](https://krakendev.io/blog/the-right-way-to-write-a-singleton) says it all.

```swift
class MySingleton {
    static let sharedInstance = MySingleton()
    private init() {}
}
```

### Match `UIImage` size to `UIImageView`

*Why?* Scaling images on the fly impact performance.

*How?* If you have no control over the incoming image size, then scale the image outside of the main thread before displaying.

### Make use of the `reuseIdentifier`

For:

- `UITableViewCell`s
- `UICollectionViewCell`s
- `UITableViewHeaderFooterView`s

If not reuse, it will create one each time a cell is displayed which impacts scrolling performance.

Remember to reuse

- headers and footers
- supplementary views

### Set views as Opaque, if possible

Opaque means no transparency defined. If not set, it will impact performance, especially the animated UIs.

*Why?* iOS needs to go deeper into the view hierarchy to figure out what color to render.

*How?* Use `Debug\Color Blended Layers` option to locate non-opaque views.

### Never block main thread

*Why?* UI rendering (*UIKit*) works in main thread.

*How?* All heavy lifting (time consuming) should be moved out of main thread, including:

- Disk I/O
- Networking, e.g., API calls
- Large computations
- Use GCD, and/or Operation

### Don't keep instantiating heavy objects

*What?* Classes like NSDateFormatter, NSCalendar are heavy to instantiate.

*How?* Create *singleton* (and it should be thread-safe if the singleton is created properly.)

### `UIScrollView` performance

Load the subviews in the scroll view only when they need to be displayed. Similar to how `UITableView` works.

### Background: `colorWithPatternImage` vs. `UIImageView`

For small image repeated/tiled, use `colorWithPatternImage`
For large full size image, use `UIImageView`
